As 2024 comes to a close, Microsoft Azure has once again proven why it’s the Beyoncé of the cloud world—consistently innovating, setting trends, and leaving everyone else scrambling to catch up.

Let’s take a stroll down memory lane and unpack the year’s standout moments and trends—and even dare to predict what 2025 might bring.



### **The Key Trends of 2024**

#### **1. AI That’s Smarter (and More Helpful) Than Your Average Team Member**  
There’s no doubt that 2024 was the year that AI became mainstream. Microsoft’s AI innovation reached new heights, with **M365 Copilot**, **Azure Copilot**, **Security Copilot**, and **GitHub Copilot** taking centre stage.

- **M365 Copilot**: Integrated into the Microsoft 365 suite, M365 Copilot brought generative AI into daily productivity tools like Word, Excel, and Teams. From creating meeting summaries in seconds to generating complex financial models in Excel, it’s revolutionised how businesses work, making AI a core part of collaboration and task execution.

- **Azure Copilot**: Designed for IT administrators and developers, Azure Copilot helps automate tasks across Azure services. From generating complex resource configurations in seconds to providing proactive cost management insights, Azure Copilot transforms cloud management into a collaborative, AI-driven experience. It’s like having a cloud architect in your pocket, minus the caffeine dependency.

- **Security Copilot**: Tailored for cybersecurity professionals, Security Copilot leverages Microsoft’s vast threat intelligence to identify, mitigate, and respond to security incidents. Whether it’s uncovering vulnerabilities or offering actionable remediation steps, Security Copilot is the trusty sidekick that every security team needs.

- **GitHub Copilot**: A favourite among developers, GitHub Copilot continues to automate mundane coding tasks and provide real-time suggestions, helping teams ship code faster and smarter. With an impressive **55% adoption rate** among developers, it’s safe to say Copilot is the coding partner you didn’t know you needed.

These Copilots collectively highlight Microsoft’s commitment to embedding AI at every layer of operations, making workflows more intelligent, secure, and efficient.


#### **2. Fabric: Your Data Estate’s New Best Friend**  
While officially launched in 2023, **Microsoft Fabric** has been a standout for many organisations in 2024. Fabric provides a unified data platform to Azure, combining analytics and data management into a single, seamless ecosystem. With features like vector search and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Fabric makes handling data less of a chore and more of a breeze for data scientists and analysts alike.


#### **3. VMware on Azure: A Renewed Spotlight**  
Broadcom’s licensing updates for VMware prompted many organisations to reevaluate their infrastructure strategies. Azure VMware Solution emerged as a key contender, providing a seamless way to migrate and modernise VMware workloads in Azure while avoiding restrictive licensing costs.


#### **4. Security Under Scrutiny**  
The CrowdStrike outage earlier this year sent shockwaves across industries, leading many organisations to reassess their cybersecurity measures. More businesses than ever are now exploring Microsoft’s comprehensive security suite, including **Defender for Cloud** and **Microsoft Sentinel**, to ensure robust threat detection and incident response.


### **Platform Engineering: Quietly Rising to the Top**

While platform engineering isn’t a new concept, 2024 has seen it rise to prominence as the must-have framework for organisations seeking to streamline operations and boost developer productivity. With its focus on building internal platforms as products for developers, platform engineering is now challenging traditional approaches like DevOps and even Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) for the “top dog” title in operational excellence.

This year, surveys revealed that **94% of organisations** implementing platform engineering reported significant improvements in operational efficiency and developer satisfaction. Azure has been at the forefront of this movement, enhancing its Kubernetes orchestration, deployment automation, and service mesh integrations to support the rise of platform teams. As we head into 2025, platform engineering’s focus on enabling **developer self-service** and **operational consistency** positions it as a key player in modern IT strategies and moves beyond just being for Kubernetes.

If you still aren't sure what Platform Engineering is, why it was needed, and how it differs from other frameworks, I recommend watching the below—a great explanation (albeit a bit lengthy):

### **Predictions for 2025: What’s Next for Azure and the Cloud?**

As Azure leads the cloud space into 2025, several trends and advancements are poised to reshape the industry. Here’s what we predict:

#### Platform Engineering Takes Centre Stage  
Platform engineering has already established itself as a cornerstone of cloud operations, but 2025 is set to be the year it becomes ubiquitous. Organisations will prioritise building internal platforms that simplify development and operational tasks. Expect Azure to double down on supporting platform engineering with enhanced tools, service meshes, and developer self-service portals. The rise of **platform as a product** will dominate DevOps strategies.

#### SMART Cloud Adoption Will Lead the Way  
The concept of **SMART cloud adoption**—**S**calable, **M**easurable, **A**utomated, **R**esilient, and **T**ailored—will dominate cloud transformation strategies. Companies will move beyond “lift-and-shift” approaches to focus on adopting cloud services that are optimised for their specific workloads and operational goals. Expect Azure to roll out frameworks and assessment tools to guide SMART adoption, helping businesses achieve a faster ROI on their cloud investments.

#### AI-Driven Operations (AIOps) Goes Mainstream  
The integration of AI into IT operations will see widespread adoption in 2025. Azure Copilot and similar AI tools will evolve to provide even more proactive insights, from predictive maintenance of cloud resources to automated anomaly detection. Expect these tools to reduce operational costs and allow teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than firefighting.

#### Unified Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Ecosystems  
While Azure continues to grow as a cloud leader, organisations will increasingly adopt multi-cloud and hybrid strategies to reduce risk and optimise costs. Microsoft is likely to introduce even more robust integrations with competing platforms like AWS and Google Cloud, making **Azure Arc** the go-to tool for managing hybrid and multi-cloud environments seamlessly.

#### Quantum Computing Enters Early Adoption  
Azure Quantum will move beyond experimental use cases and into early adoption in industries like pharmaceuticals, finance, and logistics. We expect Microsoft to introduce more accessible quantum services and developer tooling, making it easier for organisations to experiment with quantum algorithms.

#### Sustainability Becomes Non-Negotiable  
In 2025, cloud sustainability will evolve from a “nice-to-have” to a “must-have.” Azure is likely to introduce more advanced tools for measuring and optimising carbon footprints, allowing organisations to align their IT operations with sustainability goals. Expect features like energy-efficient VM options and carbon offset marketplaces integrated into the Azure portal.


### **Wrapping It All Up**  

From revolutionising AI-powered services to redefining operational models with platform engineering, 2024 has been a stellar year for Microsoft Azure. As we step into 2025, these predictions highlight an exciting road ahead, with smarter tools, tighter security, and more streamlined operations shaping the future of cloud computing.

So, whether you’re a developer, an IT leader, or just a tech enthusiast, keep an eye on Azure—it’s sure to surprise us all yet again. Here’s to another year of innovation and coffee-fuelled excellence in the cloud!
