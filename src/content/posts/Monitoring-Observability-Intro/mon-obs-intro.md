### Intro

As cloud adoption continues to grow, modern IT operations require sophisticated tools and practices to manage dynamic environments effectively. In this context, monitoring and observability have emerged as critical components of cloud management. While the terms are often used interchangeably, they serve distinct purposes. This blog post explores the differences between monitoring and observability, why both are essential, and the key factors to address when implementing them in Azure. We'll also discuss some challenges with Azure's design for DevOps versus centralised IT operations.

This post is part of my Operating Model Series. You can view the first post [here](https://cloudywaters.github.io/posts/technical/operatingmodelintro/operating-model-intro/)

### The Difference Between Monitoring and Observability

**Monitoring** and **observability** are related but serve different roles:

- **Monitoring** is the process of collecting and analysing predefined metrics and logs to identify the health and performance of a system. It involves setting thresholds, generating alerts, and visualising metrics through dashboards. Essentially, monitoring helps answer the question, "Is the system working as expected?"

- **Observability**, on the other hand, refers to the ability to understand the internal state of a system based on external outputs. It involves gathering more granular data from logs, metrics, and traces to diagnose issues in real-time and understand the underlying cause. Observability helps answer the question, "Why is the system behaving this way?"

While monitoring provides valuable alerts when something goes wrong, observability offers deeper insights, enabling teams to understand why an issue occurred and how to prevent it from happening again.

### Why We Need Both Monitoring and Observability in Modern Operations

In a cloud-native world, infrastructure is dynamic, and services are often deployed across multiple regions and interconnected systems. This complexity demands a more comprehensive approach to managing system health:

1. **Proactive Issue Resolution**: Monitoring alone can identify when an issue occurs, but observability helps resolve it proactively by providing insights into the root cause. This reduces downtime and improves system reliability.

2. **Dynamic Scaling**: Modern cloud environments, such as those running in Azure, involve auto-scaling and serverless functions that can change rapidly. Monitoring ensures that the system meets operational thresholds, while observability allows for understanding the impact of those changes on the entire ecosystem.

3. **Enhanced Security**: Monitoring can detect unusual activity, but observability enables a more detailed analysis of security events. This is crucial for modern operations where threats are sophisticated, and rapid incident response is necessary.

4. **Efficient Development and Operations Collaboration**: In DevOps practices, observability helps development and operations teams share a common understanding of system behaviour, improving collaboration and incident resolution.

### Key Factors to Address for Successful Monitoring and Observability in Azure
Here's the updated section with "Frameworks and Modern Approaches" moved above "Alerts" in the list:

### Key Factors to Address for Successful Monitoring and Observability in Azure

When designing a strategy & implementing monitoring and observability in Azure, we need to consider these key factors:

1. **Data Collection**:  
   Carefully plan which data to collect, including performance metrics, activity logs, and diagnostic data. It’s essential to strike a balance between gathering enough data to enable thorough analysis and avoiding excessive data collection that could lead to increased costs and unnecessary noise. Consider the specific metrics and logs that will provide valuable insights, such as CPU utilisation, memory usage, network latency, application response times, and security-related activity. Ensure data is collected consistently across all environments, and leverage native Azure services like Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for centralised data aggregation.

2. **Deployment**:  
   Think about the scope and scale of your monitoring setup. Ensure all critical workloads are covered, but avoid over-instrumenting, which can lead to excessive data collection and increased costs. Agility and consistency across different environments, including on-premises, hybrid, and cloud-native, is essential for comprehensive coverage.

3. **Frameworks and Modern Approaches**:  
   Modern practices like SRE and Platform Engineering emphasise proactive reliability management and efficient platform operations. Incorporating Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) into monitoring strategies helps teams understand not only when things go wrong but also the impact on overall service quality. Align monitoring policies with these frameworks to support a shift towards more proactive and reliability-focused operations and move to a top down strategy rather than a bottom up approach.

4. **Alerts**:  
   It's important to define alerting policies that reflect the operational priorities. Consider the severity levels and the types of alerts that will be actionable versus informational. Keep in mind the context of the services being monitored, and align alerts with service-level agreements (SLAs) and key performance indicators (KPIs).

5. **Alert Tuning**:  
   Regularly adjust alert thresholds based on historical data and evolving service needs. As workloads change, thresholds that were appropriate initially may no longer be effective. Embrace dynamic alerting where possible to adapt to changes automatically, but we also need to consider where this works and doesnt work.

6. **Dashboards**:  
   Focus on building dashboards that serve specific audiences effectively. Dashboards for operations teams will differ from those for executives. Think about who needs to see what data and ensure that the most relevant information is displayed. Avoid clutter and ensure that dashboards are meaningful and straightforward.

7. **Reporting**:  
   Reporting should be tailored to different stakeholder needs. While technical staff may want detailed logs and granular data, business stakeholders may prefer high-level summaries that highlight trends and risks. Ensure that reports align with SLA requirements and reflect KPIs that are relevant to the business.

8. **Stakeholders**:  
   Consider who needs access to monitoring and observability data and how that information should be distributed. Different teams may have varying needs and levels of expertise, so provide appropriate training or knowledge resources. It's also crucial to enable lower-level teams to take action, such as by creating knowledge bases (KBs) for alert remediation. This approach allows them to resolve common issues without always escalating to senior staff, improving response times and reducing operational bottlenecks.

9. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Enhanced Strategy**:  
   Consider how AI can elevate your monitoring and observability strategy to the next level of maturity. AI-driven capabilities like anomaly detection, predictive analytics, and automated root cause analysis can help identify issues before they escalate, reducing downtime and improving service reliability. By integrating AI, teams can move from reactive incident management to proactive and predictive operations, enhancing the overall efficiency of the monitoring strategy. This transition also supports continuous improvement by using AI insights to optimise thresholds, alert configurations, and even automation for remediation.

By considering these factors, you can create a monitoring and observability strategy that balances immediate operational needs with long-term reliability goals, while also setting the stage for advanced capabilities as your organisation matures.

### Azure's Initial Design: DevOps vs. Centralised IT Challenges

One of the things that has always bugged me about Azure Monitor is that it was obviously initially designed to support a DevOps-centric approach. This comes with certain limitations for traditional centralised IT operations:

1. **Decentralised Management**: In a DevOps-oriented environment, teams often manage their own resources. This decentralisation can make it difficult for a centralised IT team to maintain consistent monitoring and observability practices across all workloads. This also introduces increased effort and overhead to perform minor tasks.

2. **Tool Sprawl**: Azure provides many tools for monitoring and observability (Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Application Insights, etc.), which can lead to tool sprawl. This may not align with the centralised IT approach, where a single-pane-of-glass solution is preferred.

3. **Granular Permissions and Access**: Azure’s focus on resource-specific roles can be challenging for centralised IT teams that need broad access for monitoring across multiple subscriptions and resource groups. This requires careful configuration of role-based access controls (RBAC).

4. **Automation Challenges**: DevOps workflows in Azure often involve automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC), but centralised IT teams may not have the same level of automation expertise, potentially leading to inconsistent monitoring configurations. Another issue here is that to make changes, the application pipeline will need to be run, which often can be a barrier to making updates.

5. **Operational Hygene**: The limitation of understanding your exact status and coverage of your monitoring can be difficult to report on with this approach. There is nothing worse than being caught out with an incident that you weren't alerted for.


It seems over the past 12 months Microsoft have started to understand these limitations and have been coming up with ways to work around it. I'll highlight these in future posts.

### Wrapping Up

Monitoring and observability are indispensable for managing modern IT operations in Azure. While monitoring provides the essential alerts to identify issues, observability delivers the insights needed to diagnose and resolve them effectively. By addressing deployment, alerts, alert tuning, dashboards, reporting, and stakeholder needs, organisations can build a robust monitoring and observability strategy that aligns with their unique requirements.

However, Azure's design with a DevOps focus poses challenges for centralised IT operations, necessitating adjustments to monitoring and observability practices and the possibility of requiring additional toolsets to fulfill the complete strategy. By understanding these differences and tailoring strategies accordingly, teams can bridge the gap and achieve reliable, efficient cloud operations.
