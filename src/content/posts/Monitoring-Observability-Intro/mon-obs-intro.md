### Intro

As cloud adoption accelerates, modern IT operations require sophisticated tools and practices to effectively manage dynamic environments. In this context, monitoring and observability have become critical components of cloud management. Though often used interchangeably, the terms serve distinct purposes. This post explains the differences between monitoring and observability, their importance in Azure, and the key factors for implementing them. We’ll also touch on some challenges associated with Azure’s DevOps-oriented design versus centralised IT.

This post is part of my Operating Model Series. You can view the first post [here](https://cloudywaters.github.io/posts/technical/operatingmodelintro/operating-model-intro/).

### The Difference Between Monitoring and Observability

**Monitoring** involves tracking predefined metrics and logs to assess system health and performance, answering "Is the system working as expected?" 

**Observability**, however, goes deeper, using metrics, logs, and traces to understand "Why is the system behaving this way?"

Monitoring alerts you when something’s wrong, while observability helps you understand the root cause, offering insights to prevent future issues.

### Why We Need Both in Modern Operations

In a cloud-native world, infrastructure is constantly evolving. We need a combination of monitoring and observability to effectively manage:

- **Proactive Issue Resolution**: Monitoring detects problems; observability helps resolve them by pinpointing root causes.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Ensures the system adapts to changing conditions while understanding their impact.
- **Enhanced Security**: Identifies unusual activities and provides deeper context for threat analysis.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Facilitates shared understanding across development and operations teams.

### Key Factors to Consider for Azure Monitoring and Observability

To create a comprehensive strategy in Azure, focus on:

1. **Data Collection**:  
   Decide what metrics, logs, and diagnostic data to collect. Striking the right balance avoids unnecessary data collection costs and noise. Use native Azure tools for consistent data aggregation across environments.

2. **Deployment**:  
   A single automated approach to cover all critical workloads, maintaining consistency across all services.

3. **Frameworks and Modern Approaches**:  
   Integrate modern practices like SRE and Platform Engineering. Use Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to monitor service quality proactively and move into a top down approach.

4. **Alerts**:  
   Define policies aligned with SLIs & SLO's and / or service-level agreements (SLAs) and key performance indicators (KPIs), focusing on actionable alerts.

5. **Alert Tuning**:  
   Noise is the enemy. Regularly update alert thresholds based on historical data. Dynamic alerting can adapt to changes but needs careful application.

6. **Dashboards**:  
   Create meaningful dashboards tailored for different audiences, avoiding clutter and focusing on relevant metrics.

7. **Reporting**:  
   Tailor reports to stakeholder needs, providing technical details for IT staff and high-level summaries for business stakeholders.

8. **Stakeholders**:  
   Make data accessible to different teams and empower lower-level teams with knowledge bases for alert remediation.

9. **AI for Enhanced Strategy**:  
   Leverage AI for anomaly detection, predictive analytics, and automated root cause analysis, shifting from reactive to proactive monitoring.

### Azure's Design: DevOps vs. Centralised IT

One of the things thats always bugged me is that Microsofts initial design to Azure Monitoor was clearly catered to DevOps practices, posing challenges for traditional IT like:

- **Decentralised Management**: Makes consistent monitoring across teams difficult, adding increased effort and overhead to managing the service.
- **Tool Sprawl**: Multiple tools can complicate centralised monitoring efforts.
- **Automation Limitations**: Automation skills may vary, affecting consistent configuration. Can make what should be a minor change into a big challenge.
- **Operational Hygiene**: Difficulty understanding coverage and configurations. Gaps in monitoring coverage can lead to missed alerts.

Microsoft has started addressing these limitations, with improvements expected to continue. 

### Wrapping Up

Monitoring and observability are essential for managing Azure operations. While monitoring alerts to issues, observability helps resolve them by providing deeper insights. Addressing key factors like deployment, alerting, dashboards, and reporting can strengthen your strategy. However, Azure’s DevOps-centric design requires adjustments for traditional IT, possibly involving additional tools.
