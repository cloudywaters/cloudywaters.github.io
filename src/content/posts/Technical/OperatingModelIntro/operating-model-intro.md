## Introduction to Cloud Operating Models
Well, before we get into it I would like to just acknowledge that this is my first blog on my new site. I'm starting with an ambitious topic that I'm planning on being a series. Let's see how I go!

## Intro
I have been working in IT for a long time now. Both in an opetation capacity and also as a consultant. I have seen a lot of different environments in Azure, some great and some not so great. The ones that are'nt so great all have the same thing in common- They haven't really thought about their operating model.

When it comes to cloud computing, everyone talks about the magic of scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency. But what’s often missing from the conversation is how businesses actually manage their cloud environments effectively. Its always just jumping straight into workload projects and deploying these in an isolated context, with no real thought about how this will work in the context of the rest of the environment.

 That’s where cloud operating models come in, and if you're using Azure, understanding these models can make or break your cloud strategy.

## Why Should You Care About Cloud Operating Models?
Imagine you've just moved your business to the cloud. You’ve got your shiny new Azure setup, and everything looks great. But wait... how are you managing workloads? Who’s responsible for security? What happens when you need to scale quickly, or—worse—when something goes wrong?

A cloud operating model is the blueprint that answers these questions. It defines how your business leverages cloud resources to operate efficiently, how roles and responsibilities are structured, and how you manage things like security, compliance, and governance. It’s not just about getting into the cloud; it’s about staying there securely and efficiently.

Without a well-defined cloud operating model, your Azure environment can become a bit of a Wild West, where teams don’t know who’s responsible for what and how you actually get things done. That leads to inefficiencies, security risks, and extra costs and massive headaches that build up quickly.

## What Is a Cloud Operating Model?
In simple terms, a cloud operating model outlines how you manage your cloud infrastructure and services. In Azure, this model helps organisations establish a framework for:

Governance and Compliance: Ensuring that cloud resources are used appropriately and that security policies are followed.
Security: Setting up roles and responsibilities for protecting data and applications.
Cost Management: Keeping tabs on spending to prevent surprises at the end of the month.
Operational Excellence: Making sure everything runs smoothly, from deployments to scaling and maintenance.
People and Processes: Aligning your teams, so they know their responsibilities in the cloud world.
The Three Key Azure Cloud Operating Models
Let’s break it down into three basic cloud operating models, each tailored to different business needs:

Centralised: This is where one core team manages all the cloud resources, typically used by smaller organisations or those just starting with Azure. It keeps things simple but can be a bottleneck as you grow.

Decentralised: Here, different teams take control of their own cloud resources. It's ideal for large organisations that need flexibility, but it requires strong governance to prevent chaos.

Hybrid: A blend of the two, where some services are centrally managed, while others are decentralised. This model is common in enterprises transitioning to the cloud, providing flexibility while maintaining control.

## Wrapping Up
A cloud operating model is crucial for optimising your Azure cloud journey. It helps balance the need for agility and control, ensures your team knows what they're doing, and keeps your cloud costs and risks in check. Whether you’re just starting out or already well into your cloud transformation, having the right operating model will help you get the most out of Azure.

The next step? Let's dive deeper. I'm going to focus on the centralised operating model for the series as its the most common. I might circle back at some point and look at the others one day :)
