🛠️ **Product Design:** Designing innovative and impactful cloud products that push the boundaries of what's possible.

🔧 **Operational Service Design & Management:** Orchestrating seamless service delivery, optimizing operational efficiency, and ensuring customer satisfaction.

☁️ **Cloud Platform Expertise:** Proficient in the Azure cloud platform, including CAF, WAF, Compute, and IAC, leveraging these tools to build scalable and resilient solutions.

🔐 **Identity & Security:** Prioritizing the utmost security, I specialise in implementing robust identity and security frameworks to safeguard critical assets.
